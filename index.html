I am currently a research intern at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/">Bocconi University</a> for my M2 internship, where I investigate gradient flows in the geometry of the Sinkhorn divergence under the supervision of <a href="https://hugolav.github.io/">Hugo Lavenant</a>. I am looking for a PhD position in this field starting late 2024. 
Some of my academic reports can be found under the "Works" section, and my CV under the "About me" section.
