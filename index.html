I am currently a student in mathematical data modelling and analysis at the <a href="https://www.master-mva.com">MVA</a> master program, and I will be researching gradient flows in the geometry of the Sinkhorn divergence at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/">Bocconi University</a> for my M2 internship under the supervision of <a href="https://hugolav.github.io/">Hugo Lavenant</a> from april to october 2024. I am looking for a PhD position in this field starting late 2024. 

Some of my academic reports can be found under the "Works" section, and my Curriculum Vitae under the "About me" section.
