I am currently a student in mathematical data modeling and analysis at the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com) master program, looking for a research internship starting in April 2024 possibly leading to a PhD.

Some of my academic reports can be found under the "Works" section, and my Curriculum Vitae under the "About me" section.
