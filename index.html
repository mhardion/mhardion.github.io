I am currently a research intern at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/">Bocconi University</a> for my M2 internship, where I investigate gradient flows in the geometry of the Sinkhorn divergence under the supervision of <a href="https://hugolav.github.io/">Hugo Lavenant</a>.
Some of my academic reports can be found under the <a href="works">"Works"</a> section, and my CV under the <a href="aboutme">"About me"</a> section.
