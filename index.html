I am an aspiring researcher in mathematics, more specifically in fields close to Optimal Transport, Calculus of Variations and applications in Machine Learning. I have recently defended my master's thesis for the <a href="https://www.master-mva.com">MVA</a> program successfully, and I will be looking for a PhD position starting in 2025.
