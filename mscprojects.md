# Master's thesis
My thesis "Gradient flows in the geometry of the Sinkhorn divergence" was made at [Bocconi university](https://www.unibocconi.eu/) under the supervision of [Hugo Lavenant](https://hugolav.github.io/). It led to the article "Gradient Flows of Potential Energies in the Geometry of Sinkhorn Divergences", see [Research](research).
