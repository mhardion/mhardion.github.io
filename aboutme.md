# Short presentation
<img src="https://mhardion.github.io/assets/img/img.png" alt="Picture" width="200" style="float:left;margin:10px 10px 0px 0px">I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Théo Lacombe](https://tlacombe.github.io/) and [François-Xavier Vialard](https://angkor.univ-mlv.fr/~vialard/) in the [Laboratoire d'Informatique Gaspard Monge (LIGM)](https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/home/) at the [Université Gustave Eiffel](https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/) where I study optimization problems related to entropic optimal transport and gradient flows. I am a graduate from [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr)'s [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com) (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) master program, and from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr)' engineering curriculum with a specialization in stochastic modelling, numerical analysis, signal processing and machine learning. I have conducted my master's research internship under the supervision of [Hugo Lavenant](https://hugolav.github.io/) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/), where I researched gradient flows in the geometry of the Sinkhorn divergence (see the [research](research) section).

My current interests lie within the theory of optimal transport and its entropic regularization, gradient flows, differential geometry on the space of measures and connections with machine learning, sampling methods, and mathematical modelling.

I am also curious about applications in the fields of climate and ecology, and hope to explore meaningful intersections with my current field.
