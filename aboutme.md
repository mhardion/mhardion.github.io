I am currently a student in mathematical data modelling and analysis at the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com) master program of [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr), and in my final year of [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr)' engineering diploma after a specialization in stochastic modelling, numerical analysis, signal processing and machine learning. I am looking for a research internship starting in April 2024, potentially leading to a PhD position, to pursue developing my research skills.

My current interests lie at the intersection between probability, statistics, geometrical and topological data analysis. I lean towards theoretical aspects while giving importance to applicability in real-world problems, especially the great challenges of the 21st century such as energy and climate.
