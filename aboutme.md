I am currently a student in mathematical data modelling and analysis at the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com) master program, and in my final year of [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr)'s engineering diploma. I am looking for a research internship starting in April 2024, potentially leading to a PhD position, to pursue developing my research skills.

My full CV can be found [here](assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
