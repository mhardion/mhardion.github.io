I have recently completed my master's research internship at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/">Bocconi University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://hugolav.github.io/">Hugo Lavenant</a>, as the final step of my education in mathematics and data science at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr)'s [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com) master program, after a specialization in stochastic modelling, numerical analysis, signal processing and machine learning within [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr)' engineering diploma.

My current interests lie within the theory of optimal transport and its entropic regularization, gradient flows, differential geometry on the space of measures and connections with machine learning, sampling methods, and mathematical modelling.

I am also curious about applications to the field of climate and ecology, and hope to explore meaningful intersections with my current field.
