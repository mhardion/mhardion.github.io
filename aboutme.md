I am currently a research intern at <a href="https://www.unibocconi.eu/">Bocconi University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://hugolav.github.io/">Hugo Lavenant</a>, as the final step of my education in mathematics and data science at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr)'s [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com) master program, after a specialization in stochastic modelling, numerical analysis, signal processing and machine learning within [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr)' engineering diploma. This internship revolves around JKO gradient flows in the geometry of the Sinkhorn divergence, both on a theoretical standpoint and numerically to correlate the results obtained in both approaches.

My current interests lie within the theory of optimal transport and calculus of variations, differential geometry on the space of measures and connections with machine learning, MCMC methods, stochastic modeling etc. I am also concerned with the great challenges of the 21st century, especially climate change and the ecological transition, and hope to make contributions towards addressing these issues whether independantly or simultaneously with my work in mathematics.
